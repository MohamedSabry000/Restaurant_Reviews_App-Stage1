 Welcome and have a great time ....


# Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 1 Clone Project
   This is a Restaurant Reviews App, made for Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree project
   Project provided by Udacity via GitHub
   Clone it or download from: (https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1)
   This project is part of Udacity FEND Certification Course

This is the 5th project for the Front End Developer Nanodegree program
This is a restaurant reviewer application/website,for which I was given a basic repository
For the moment it is built to show just a certain area,an area in the USA
Select the drop down menu and choose an available area
You can see details about the restaurants ,if you choose to view more you will be able to see the reviews and restaurant location

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.



## Steps to complete the project

1. Clone the repository or download the zip-file of the master branch [Udacity repo is available here](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1).
2. After exploring the given code,you need to start converting the provided site to use with a range of display sizes (adaptive to    screen widths from 320 px up to 1280px+),and Responsive images (sizing appropriate to the viewport).
3. Then implemente accessibility features in the HTML sites.Accessible images with alternate text, focus management allows easy
    navigation of the site and semnatically defined elements and ARIA roles
4. After that add a ServiceWorker script to cache requests to all of the siteâ€™s assets so that any page that has been visited by a    user will be accessible when the user is offline.



## Requirements:
### Python
If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

### Leaflet.js and Mapbox

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.



### What do I do from here?

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

    * In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
   * Note -  For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as `python` by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 8000`.
2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
3. Explore the provided code, and start making a plan to implement the required features in three areas: responsive design, accessibility and offline use.
4. Write code to implement the updates to get this site on its way to being a mobile-ready website.



## How to run this app
Clone or download this repo project to your local machine, unzip and serve up a HTTP server and open up index.html in local host port [Number Of Your Port].
